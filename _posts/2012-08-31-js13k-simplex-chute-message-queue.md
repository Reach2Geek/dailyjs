###js13kGames

![js13kGames](/images/posts/js13k.png)

[js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) is a HTML5 and JavaScript game development competition.  It's currently open for entries, and the competition will close on the 13th September 2012.  The basic rule states that entries must be less than 13 KB, but [please read through all of the rules before entering](http://js13kgames.com/#rules).

The judges include Michal Budzynski (Firefox OS developer) and Rob Hawkes (Mozilla), and the competition was organised by Andrzej Mazur.

###simplex-noise.js

[simplex-noise.js](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js) (npm: [simplex-noise](https://npmjs.org/package/simplex-noise)) by Jonas Wagner is a [simplex noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise) implementation, which is often used to generate noise for graphics.  The author has posted a [plasma demo](http://jsfiddle.net/UL69K/5/) to jsFiddle.

###Media Chooser

[Media Chooser](http://chute.github.com/media-chooser/) (GitHub: [chute / media-chooser](https://github.com/chute/media-chooser)) from Chute is a client-side library for working with [Chute's media API](http://www.getchute.com/).  Files can be uploaded or selected from social networks like Facebook and Instagram.  It's an extremely simple way of accepting file uploads in a single page application without the traditional server-side requirements.

###User Message Queue

[User Message Queue](https://github.com/rob-murray/ui-message-queue/) (License: _MIT_) by [Robert Murray](http://robertomurray.co.uk/) is a FIFO message queue.  It allows messages to be pushed to a queue that will be displayed one after another in a suitable container element.  It's simple and lightweight, so it might work well in combination with a client-side toolkit like Bootstrap.
